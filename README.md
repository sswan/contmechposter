# Continuum Mechanics Equation Sheet

This is an equation sheet for anyone interested in solid mechanics or continuum mechanics. It defines many of the common scalars, vectors, and tensors in tensor notation and in indicial notation. It includes notes about other common names or interesting properties.

Some sample values:

* Deformation Gradient

* Left Stretch

* Right Stretch

* Left Cauchy-Green Tensor

* Right Cauchy-Green Tensor

* Euler Strain

* Logarithmic Strain

* Lagrange Strain

* Vorticity Tensor

* First Piola-Kirchhoff Stress

* Second Piola-Kirchhoff Stress
